## About Me 🎶🎵🎲🎮🛠️🚗

**⚡ Personal Interests** 

I love problem solving, ML & AI, cybersecurity, open source & privacy focused applications and general modifications. I am also passionate about cars, outdoors, travelling, music and animals.

**Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence:** 
- I run the following locally on my PC for Text Generation: TextGenUI with custom LLMs from HuggingFace. AutoGen connected to Local LLM or ChatGPT to create teams of Agents. MemGPT connected to AutoGen & Local LLM or ChatGPT to increase context length for the teams of agents.
- I run the following locally for Image Generation: Automatic1111 (A1111) & ComfyUI user interfaces. I use A1111 for most models to generate images, I have also integrated Stable Diffusion for AI Video Generation, I have also experimented with 3d modelling, image to text etc. I use ComfyUI for Stable Diffusion XL Model with Refiner, this is the best local model I've used for image generation but cant be used with A1111, I have detailed the set up for this in [this repo](https://github.com/KC-7/ecommerce).
- I use So-Vits-SVC to change voices using trained models.
- I have also developed applications that incorpate openai's api for text and image generation, example: [AI Art Generation](https://www.cre8ai.art/) & [AI Travel Planner](https://ai-testing.herokuapp.com/).

**CyberSecurity:** 
- Please see my 4th and 5th portfolio projects to see securily built Django websites.
- I have basic experience with Kali Linux and its included applictions.
- I have basic experience with tools such as Flipper Zero and custom installations on same.

**Opensource & Privacy Focused Applications:**
- I am a strong supporter of Opensource Projects and Privacy Focused Applications.
- I have experience with Raspberry Pis, 3d Printing & Modelling, VPNS, TOR, Tails, etc.
- I have a strong dislike for spyware, trackers, unessacry cookies, selling and collection of personal data, online censorship, etc.

**General Modifications:**
- I love to test things and push the bounderies. I believe modifying is an exciting way to learn more about the technology you own. I have carried out firmware modifications to a few electric scooters, 3d printers, flipper zero, gaming consoles such as PS4 and PSP, etc.
- I have also built my own PC and set up raspeberry pis for different purposes.
